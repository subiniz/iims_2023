JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. 

JavaScript is a lightweight programming language that web developers commonly use to create more dynamic interactions when developing web pages, applications, servers, and or even games.

Developers generally use JavaScript alongside HTML and CSS.

# What is it used for?
The initial versions of the scripting language were for internal use only. After Netscape submitted it to ECMA International as a standard specification for web browsers, JavaScript pioneered the release of ECMAScript (JS Standard).

It was a general-purpose scripting language to ensure web pages’ interoperability across different browsers and devices.

JavaScript has continued to grow alongside new browsers like Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome since then. The latter even started developing the first modern JavaScript engine, called V8, which compiles bytecode into native machine code.

Today, JavaScript has plenty of frameworks and libraries to simplify complex projects, such as AngularJS, jQuery, and ReactJS.

# Is Nodejs and Javascript same?
In a word, NO!
To understand the "NO", we first of all need to understand Client-Side Language and Server-Side Language.

# Node JS VS Vanilla JS
| Vanilla | Node |
| ------ | ------ |
| Javascript is a programming language that is used for writing scripts on the website.  | NodeJS is a Javascript runtime environment. |
| Javascript can only be run in the browsers. | We can run Javascript outside the browser with the help of NodeJS. |
| Javascript is used in frontend development.| Nodejs is used in server-side development. |
| Javascript is capable enough to add HTML and play with the DOM. | Nodejs does not have capability to add HTML tags. |
|JavaScript running any engine like Spider monkey (FireFox), JavaScript Core (Safari), V8 (Google Chrome). | Node JS only run in a V8 engine which is mainly used by google chrome. And javascript program which will be written under this Node JS will always run in V8 Engine.|

## And NO! Java and Javascript isn't the same thing.
Java is an OOP programming language used to create applications that run in virtual machines or browsers, while JavaScript is an OOP scripting language used to run code in web browsers. Java code needs to be compiled, while JavaScript is in text.

# How to run JS?
